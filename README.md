## Discussion

I did not like making this at all, as you can see, I made Minesweeper in a heavily OO langage and I made it as functional as I could.

I have been writing functional programming for _much_ longer than I have with OO and I just couldn't see the benefits of using OO here over functional programming.

I also rushed the hell out of this, there is a lot of duplicate code, name conventions aren't followed and inefficient loops.
